# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

Credit cards have proliferated nowadays, which lead to the increase of associated fraud. Traditionally businesses review transactions manually, which is time-consuming and costly. Hence, machine learning algorithms have been applied widely to detect credit card fraudulent transactions. However, identifying the best-fit algorithms is still a big challenge for researchers. Besides, the issues with highly skewness data lead to the re-sampling deployment to achieve better results. This study proposes and compares five different learning models: logistic regression, k-nearest neighbours, decision tree, random forest, and autoencoder. Besides, the influences of sampling technique and feature reduction also consider finding the optimal solutions to predict fraud. The results show that random forest and logistic regression outperform the other algorithms. Besides, the undersampling method and feature reduction using PCA could improve the performance of the proposed models.
